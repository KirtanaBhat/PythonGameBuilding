# PythonGameBuilding-SnakeSaga
The Snake Game is a classic game implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around the 
screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging, requiring the player to 
strategize and plan their moves to achieve a high score.
